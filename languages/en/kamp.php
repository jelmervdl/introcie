<h2>Camp!</h2>
<p>The Introductory camp is the most fun way to begin your study year! During the course of an entire weekend from 30th of August till the 1st of September you'll be able to participate in a bunch of awesome activities, you'll be served meals and you'll just have a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It's the best way to get to know your fellow students, first years as well as higher years, before your study even begins. There's always a very sociable, non-committal atmosphere, with enough moments for you to do whatever you want to (play a cardgame, play football, go crazy or just gab with with your fellow students, you name it!). But don't worry, there's enough on the program to never get bored if you really can't think of anything. ;)</p>
